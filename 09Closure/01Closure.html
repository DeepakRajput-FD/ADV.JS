<body><h1>Closures In JS</h1>

    <p>
      A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed)
      with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).
    </p>
    <p>
      A function bundled together with its lexical environment makes a closure.
    </p>
    <p>functions are the heart of JavaScript.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Lexical Environment => </b>A lexical environment in JavaScript is a
      data structure that stores the variables and functions that are defined in
      the current scope and all of the outer scopes. It is also known as the
      lexical scope or the lexical closure

    <script>

        //basically it is used to call function in the function. and use the variable 
        
        let c = 30;
        function outerOuter()
        //it is lexical scope of outer 
        {
            let b = 20
            function outer() 
            {
        //it is lexical scope of outer 
                console.log(b);
                let a = 10;
                function inner() {
                    console.log(c);
                    // console.log(b);
                    console.log(a);
                }

            }
            outer();
