    <h4>1. Can you provide a brief overview of the history of JavaScript and its significance in web development</h4>

    <h5>
        JavaScript is develped by brendan eich in 1995 the company name was Netscape. and initially name was live script.
        and after acquired by sun microsystem and after oracle corporation is buy sun microsystem. oracle corporation is maintained by JavaScript.
        <br>
        JavaScript is lightweight and single threaded and event based and interprted based compiled programming language. JavaScript is also known scripting for webpages. and JavaScript is also known as dynamically typed or loosly typed programming language. JavaScript is also use for frontend as well as backend side (Nodejs).
        <br>
        significance =>
         JavaScript is essential for creating dynamic and interactive web pages.
         it is used such as :
         Adding animations and other visual effects
        Validating user input
        Creating interactive forms
        Building web applications
        Developing single-page applications (SPAs)
        And much more

        (4)Objects
        (5)events

        4. How does JavaScript differ from other programming languages?   
    </h4>
    <h5>
        Interpreted vs Compiled: Unlike many languages that require compiling before running, JavaScript is interpreted by the browser directly, making development faster and more dynamic. 
        <br>
        Client-side vs Server-side: Traditionally, JavaScript reigned on the client-side (web browsers), adding interactivity to web pages. However, Node.js allows JavaScript to run on the server-side, expanding its reach.
        <br>
        Dynamic typing: Unlike statically typed languages where data types are fixed, JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning data types can change during runtime, offering flexibility but potentially leading to errors.
        <br>
        Event-driven vs Thread-based: JavaScript uses an event-driven approach, handling multiple tasks asynchronously, whereas many languages rely on separate threads for concurrency.
        <br>
        Prototypal inheritance: JavaScript primarily uses prototypal inheritance for object-oriented programming, differing from classical inheritance models in other languages.
        <br>
        Beyond web or Features of js : While web development remains its core strength, JavaScript is finding applications in mobile development, desktop apps, and even game development through frameworks like React Native and Electron.
